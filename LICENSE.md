Phase-stretch Adaptive Gradient-field Extractor (PAGE) algorithm is developed in Jalali Lab at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). PAGE is a spin-off from research on the photonic time stretch technique at UCLA. More information about the technique can be found on our group website: http://www.photonics.ucla.edu. The code was developed by Madhuri Suthar with further refinement by Callen MacPhee.

The source code provided in the repository is for research and evaluation purposes. PAGE is an extension of an earlier code
released by Jalali Lab called Phase Stretch Transform (PST). PST software is subject to US patent #10,275,891.
